# Contributing Guidelines

## Cross-Platform Software

We encourage the writing of portable code. Often only little additional work is needed to allow the installation using Homebrew not only on **macOS** but also on a variety of **Linux** distributions. This has a wonderful side effect: people using the **Windows** Terminal or Subsystem for Linux (WSL) can easily install, use and update our software as well.

## Versioning

We encourage the use of either:

- date-based versioning i.e. the `YYYY-MM-DD` format (e.g. `2020-04-05`)
- [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) i.e. the `major.minor.patch` format (e.g. `2.0.7`)

for the releases.
